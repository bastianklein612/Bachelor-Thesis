\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{ch:conclusion}

In the last chapter of this thesis, (we summarize our results), evaluate how well the developed model and controller work as a foundation for further research and discuss the performance of the reinforcement learning agent in coordinating leg movements.
Finally, we will provide an outlook towards possibly interesting future expansions to our work.

\section{Evaluation}

MATLAB Simulink proved to be a valuable and reliable platform for the modeling and simulation of hexapod robots.
\todo{Evaluate MATLAB Simulink in more detail}





We found the learning of the RL agents to progress quite slow. 
This could probably be improved on by more carefully tuning the agents parameters and a more detailed reward function.



\section{Outlook - Future Work}



\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Controller improvements:
		\subitem Curve walking
		\subitem Adaptation to uneven terrain
		\subitem 
	
	\item Expand Reinforcement Learning from just leg coordination towards controlling the whole movement process
	
	\item Use other MATLAB Tools such as Hardware Co-Simulation
	
	\item 
	
\end{itemize}
