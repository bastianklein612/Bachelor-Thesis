\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{ch:conclusion}

In the last chapter of this thesis, we summarize our results, evaluate how well the developed model and controller work as a foundation for further research and discuss the performance of the reinforcement learning agent in coordinating leg movements.
Finally, we will provide an outlook towards possibly interesting future expansions to our work.

\section{Outlook - Future Work}



\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Controller improvements:
		\subitem Curve walking
		\subitem Adaptation to uneven terrain
		\subitem 
	
	\item Expand Reinforcement Learning from just leg coordination towards controlling the whole movement process
	
	\item Use other MATLAB Tools such as Hardware Co-Simulation
	
	\item
