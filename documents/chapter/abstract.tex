\section*{Abstract}
In this thesis we aimed to create a comprehensive, modular and easy to understand model of a hexapod robot using the MATLAB Simulink environment.
The model which came out at the end of the development can be easily expanded and lays the footings for future research to build on.
I the course of our work we conducted several tests to verify the functionality of the final product.
For this we conceived and implemented a movement controller which is able to move the hexapod in several different, static gait patterns.
Concluding our work and providing impulses for future expansions upon our model, we utilized MATLAB vast capabilities to learn the coordination of the hexapods legs via Reinforcement Learning.
The trained RL agent is capable of moving the robot in a gait similar to ...
