\section*{Abstract}
In this thesis we aimed to create a comprehensive, modular and easy to understand model of a hexapod robot using the MATLAB Simulink environment.
The final model can be easily expanded and lays the foundation for future research to build on.
During the course of our work we continuously performed tests on the model to ensure the functionality of each module and the final product.
For this we conceived a movement controller which is able to steer the hexapod in several different, static gait patterns.
Concluding our work and providing impulses for future expansions upon our model, we utilized MATLABs vast capabilities to learn the coordination of the hexapods legs via Reinforcement Learning.
The trained RL agent is capable of moving the robot in a gait similar to ...
