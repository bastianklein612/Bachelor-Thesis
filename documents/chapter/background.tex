\section{MATLAB}
\subsection{Simulink}
\textit{Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered}} is a \textit{MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}}-based graphical block-diagramming tool developed by the company \textit{MathWorks\textsuperscript{\textregistered}} intended for designing and simulating dynamical systems.
It provides an expansive library of continuous and discrete blocks, which enables the user to create systems from various domains.
The creation of a Simulink model is done by connecting blocks via edges in a GUI.
The blocks transform input data provided by the connected edges, the edges forward the data to other blocks connected downstream.
Blocks can be put into subsystems, creating different levels of abstraction.
For reuse, subsystems can be placed in libraries, so that all linked subsystems can be updated in one place.
Once a system is build it can be simulated using on of the many solvers provided.

\subsection{Simscape}
\textit{Simscape\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}} is a block library developed by \textit{MathWorks\textsuperscript{\textregistered}} with which it is possible to model physical system within the Simulink environment.
It is capable of modeling and simulating systems such as electric circuits, hydraulics or rigid body interactions.
Simscape also provides a MATLAB based language to enable text-based development of custom components.
 



\section{Inverse Kinematics}
Inverse Kinematics(IK) is a term predominately used in robotics or computer graphics.
It describes the process of calculating the joint angles needed to place the end of a kinematic chain, such as a robotic manipulator, at a given position and orientation.
